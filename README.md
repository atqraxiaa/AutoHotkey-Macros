## You can verify the authenticity of any AutoHotkey scripts created in this repository:

### 1. For `.ahk` (uncompiled) scripts
- Open the script in a text editor to review the source code directly.
- This ensures the script contains only the intended logic.

### 2. For compiled `.exe` scripts
- Extract the files if needed using standard AutoHotkey methods.
- Check the extracted files in: ```%appdata%\AutoHotkey\Compiler```
- Inspect these files to verify the internal scripts and resources.

> 🔹 **Tip:** Always check scripts before running them to ensure safety and transparency.
